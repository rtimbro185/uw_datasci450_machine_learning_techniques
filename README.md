**ABOUT THIS COURSE:** <br>
Machine learning is an integral tool for data science. In this course, you’ll develop the ability to apply powerful machine learning and predictive analytics methods. We’ll cover key machine learning models — including classifiers, regression and unsupervised learning — as well as model theory. You’ll learn how to construct and apply these models to data science problems, including algorithm selection, model training and model evaluation.

**WHAT STUDENTS LEARN:**
* Data science methodology and processes you can apply in your organization
* Theory of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models
* Methods of feature selection and regularization
* Techniques for applying classification, regression and unsupervised machine learning models
* Aspects of linear and nonlinear models
* Deep learning models and their relationship to other machine learning models
